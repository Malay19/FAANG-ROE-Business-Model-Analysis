# FAANG Profitability & Business Model Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes how different Big Tech firms generate Return on Equity (ROE) using DuPont decomposition and regression modeling.

The goal is to show that firms follow distinct paths to profitability rather than a single universal formula.

Dataset: Firm-level financial data (2015–2024)

## Research Questions
- Do margins, asset turnover, and leverage impact ROE equally across firms?
- Did profitability drivers shift post-COVID?
- Are business models structurally different?

---

## Methodology
- DuPont decomposition
- Regression modeling with firm interactions
- Pre- vs Post-COVID dummy analysis
- ROE volatility analysis

---

## Key Findings
- Apple’s ROE is strongly driven by efficiency.
- Amazon’s ROE responds more to margin expansion.
- Margin discipline became more important post-2020.
- Profitability persistence exists but is not dominant.
